x = 3.14
y = -4
z = 5

result = x + y  # not printed, but it's -0.8599999999999999
print(round(x))       # → 3  (rounds 3.14 to nearest int)
print(abs(y))         # → 4  (absolute value of -4)
print(pow(4, 3))      # → 64 (4³)
print(max(x, y, z))   # → 5  (largest of the three)
print(min(x, y, z))   # → -4 (smallest of the three)
